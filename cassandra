Notes on Apache Cassandra 
======================


#### CQLSH References

- [DESCRIBE]( http://www.datastax.com/docs/1.1/references/cql/DESCRIBE )


#### Starting Cassandra

    sudo cassandra -f


#### Stopping Cassandra

Find the process ID by using the following command:
    
    ps auwx | grep cassandra


Kill the process
    
    sudo kill [pid]


#### Start Cassandra as a service

    sudo /etc/init.d/cassandra start
    sudo /etc/init.d/cassandra stop
    
Starting automatically at boot:

    sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/cassandra

For Ubuntu, add it to the startup by executing

    sudo update-rc.d cassandra defaults
    
To stop the service:

    sudo /etc/init.d/cassandra stop

#### Installation

Installation will create following directories. Uses of them are mentioned within the brackets.

    /var/lib/cassandra (data directories)
    /var/log/cassandra (log directory)
    /var/run/cassandra (runtime files)
    /usr/share/cassandra (environment settings)
    /usr/share/cassandra/lib (JAR files)
    /usr/bin (binary files)
    /usr/sbin
    /etc/cassandra (configuration files)
    /etc/init.d (service startup script)
    /etc/security/limits.d (cassandra user limits)
    /etc/default


#### Official Package To Install On Debian(tm) (not a product of Debian(tm))

DataStax hosts debian packages that include Cassandra and various tools for working with Cassandra.

Alternatively, you can install directly from the ASF repositories by inserting the following into /etc/apt/sources.list:

    deb http://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/debian 20x main
    deb-src http://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/debian 20x main

You will want to replace 11x by the series you want to use: `10x for the 1.0.x series, 08x for the 0.8.x series, etc... You will not automatically get major version updates unless you change the series, but that is a feature.

If you run apt-get update now, you will see an error similar to this:

    GPG error: http://www.apache.org unstable Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY F758CE318D77295D

This simply means you need to add the PUBLIC_KEY. You do that like this:

    gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys F758CE318D77295D
    gpg --export --armor F758CE318D77295D | sudo apt-key add -

Starting with the 0.7.5 debian package, you will also need to add public key 2B5C1B00 using the same commands as above:

    gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 2B5C1B00
    gpg --export --armor 2B5C1B00 | sudo apt-key add -

(The list of Apache contributors public keys is available at http://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/KEYS).

Then you may install Cassandra by doing:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install cassandra
    Some things to be aware of:

The configuration files are located in /etc/cassandra
Start-up options (heap size, etc) can be configured in /etc/default/cassandra


#### Uninstalling Cassandra

Uninstall Cassandra using apt-get

    apt-get remove cassandra

Remove data/log/ directories

    rm -rf /var/lib/cassandra
    rm -rf /var/log/cassandra
    rm -rf /etc/cassandra
